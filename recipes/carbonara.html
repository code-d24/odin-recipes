              Preparation
           </h2>
            <Ol>
                <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. 
                <p> 
                    salt and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
                </p>
                <li>
                    While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. 
                <p>
                    pancetta from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate
                </p> 
                <p>
                    2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no 
                <p> 
                    streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    several cranks of pepper and set aside.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in 
                <p> 
                    a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over 
                </p>
                    medium. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally,
                <p>
                    until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out pancetta 
                <p>
                    and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes 
                <p>
                    shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 
                </p>
                <p>
                     1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and
                <p> 
                    water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid into reserved egg mixture, then very 
                <p> 
                    slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted
                </p>
                <p>
                     and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful 
                </p>
                <p>
                    at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix in pancetta and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.
