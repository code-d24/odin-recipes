    <h2>Description</h2>
    Start your morning off right with a stack of sweeet, delicious banana pancakes!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1/2 cups all purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled off</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 small, over-ripe banana, peeled (the browner, the better)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup plus 2 tbsp. low fat milk</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>Cooking spray (for pan)</li>
            <li>Maple syrup, confectioner's sugar, or any other toppings of your choice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>In a small bowl, mash the banana with a fork until almost smooth. Whisk in 
                the eggs, then add the milk and vanilla and whisk until well blended. Pour 
                the banana mixture and the melted butter into the flour mixture. Fold the 
                batter gently with a rubber spatula until just blended; do not over-mix. The 
                batter will be thick and lumpy.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>Set a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat until hot. Put a pad of butter
                and one tablespoon vegetable oil onto the griddle, and swirl it around. Drop 
                the batter by 1/4-cupfuls onto the griddle, spacing the pancakes about 2 inches 
                apart. Cook until a few holes form on top of each pancake and the underside is 
                golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until the bottom is 
                golden brown and the top is puffed, 1 to 2 minutes more. Using the spatula, transfer 
                the pancakes to a serving plate.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>Wipe the griddle clean with paper towels, add more butter and oil, and repeat with
                the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes while still hot with maple syrup, sliced 
                bananas and confectioners' sugar if desired.</li>
        <p></p>
        </ol>
